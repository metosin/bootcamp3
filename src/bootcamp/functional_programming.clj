;; Functional programming:
;;

; Some definitions:
;
;    ...style of building the structure and elements of computer programs,
;    that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and
;    avoids state and mutable data.
;
;    source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming
;
; Commonly:
;
; * First-class and higher-order functions
; * Pure functions
;
; Also commonly required:
; * closures
;
; Modern functional concept:
; * persistent data-structures

;
; First-class and higher-order functions:
; ---------------------------------------
;

; First-class function:

(fn [a b] (+ a b))

; Higher-order functions:

; - functionas a arguments:
(filter odd? [1 2 3 4 5])

; - functions as return values:
(let [add-2 (partial + 2)]
  (add-2 40))

;
; Purity:
; -------
; Clojure is a 'practical' language, no strict purity enforcement (like in Haskell)
; How ever, clojure has a strong tendency towards purity (persistent datastructures, STM)
;

; Example of a pure function:

(defn hello [message your-name]
  (str message ", " your-name))

; Some non-pure versions:

(defn hello [message your-name]
  (println "generating hello message for" your-name)
  (str message ", " your-name))

(def message (atom nil))                                    ; known as "evil global mutable state"
                                                            ; http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/148108/why-is-global-state-so-evil

(defn hello [your-name]
  (str (deref message) ", " your-name))

(reset! message "Hello")
(hello "world")                                             ;=> "Hello, world"

(reset! message "Moi")
(hello "maailma")                                           ;=> "Moi, maailma"

; Why purity matters?
; Pure functions are easy to develop, test and reason about.

; Application with _only_ pure functions does nothing, so some non-pure parts are
; always required. The Right Way(tm) is to be as pure as possible and isolate
; non-pure functions to some non-pure units.

;
; Closures:
; ---------
;

(defn greeter [message]            ; <- message here
  (fn [your-name]
    (str message ", " message)))   ; <- used as closure here

(let [g (greeter "Hullo")]
  ; now g 'closes over string "Hullo"'
  (println (g "world!")))
